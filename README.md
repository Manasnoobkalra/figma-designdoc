## Caution, Floor slippery when wet

This repo is a work in progress, and it's not ready for the prime time, but if you want to use it you can!

This plugin exports a simple website using a bunch of conventions and one or many Figma documents as the structure. We named the plugin "design doc" because initially, we used it to export a design guideline, but we have been using it for many other things.

If you want to see an example, you can build this website using this Figma files as a base.
